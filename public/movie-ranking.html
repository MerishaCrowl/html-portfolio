<h2>Top 3 best movies I've ever seen!</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Firestarter</h3>
<p>
The original one by Stephen King.<br />
Hands down greatest movie ever.<br /> 
Drew Barrymore at her best!<br />
</p>

<h3>Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead</h3>
<p>
Who doesn't love Christina Applegate?! "I'm right on top of that Rose!"<br />
"The dishes are done, man."
</p>

<h3>Demolition Man</h3>
<p>
Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes, and Sandra Bullock, need I say more?<br />
Not sure I can limit my thoughts to one sentence on this one...<br /> 
but if I have to...what are those 3 seashells for anyway?<br /> 
We may never know...
